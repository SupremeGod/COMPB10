## Course Description
This course is designed as a first course in software engineering for mixed-majors, with an emphasis on the Computer 
Science major. Students will use the object-oriented programming language Python to learn the fundamentals of programming. 
Topics include: variables, sequence, selection, iteration, the software life-cycle, as well as common programming algorithms 
such as sorting and searching. Not open to students who have previously received credit for COMS B10.


## Student Learning Outcomes
* Describe and apply the software development life-cycle to a given problem. 
* Describe the principles of structured programming and be able to describe, design, implement, and test structured programs using currently accepted methodology and control structures. 
* Explain what an algorithm is and then be able to translate an algorithm into a programming language.
