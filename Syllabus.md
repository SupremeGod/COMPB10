## Course Description
This course is designed as a first course in software engineering for mixed-majors, with an emphasis on the Computer 
Science major. Students will use the object-oriented programming language Python to learn the fundamentals of programming. 
Topics include: variables, sequence, selection, iteration, the software life-cycle, as well as common programming algorithms 
such as sorting and searching. Not open to students who have previously received credit for COMS B10.


## Student Learning Outcomes
* Describe and apply the software development life-cycle to a given problem. 
* Describe the principles of structured programming and be able to describe, design, implement, and test structured programs using currently accepted methodology and control structures. 
* Explain what an algorithm is and then be able to translate an algorithm into a programming language.

## Equity and Inclusion
Bakersfield College is committed to creating and fostering a positive, safe and conducive learning environment based on open 
communication where diversity, equity, and inclusion are recognized, valued and inform thoughtful decision-making and action. 
BC embraces individual difference and expects all employees and students to respect these differences and accept an understanding 
that individuals have unique perspectives, behaviors, and worldviews that may be different from their own.

## Course Policies  
Each student in this course will abide by the Academic Honesty Policy described in the Academic Information and Standards section 
of the Bakersfield College Catalog. Collaboration in class while working on assignments is encouraged. Various projects in class will require group work. Students who do not participate equally with others on assigned group projects will receive a grade of zero.
Please be sensitive to the learning environment and the needs of each and every student in class. Avoid causing distractions or 
engaging in non-class activity. Turn cells phones off before class starts and respond only after class ends. Unless it is an 
emergency, do not leave class to answer the phone and do not text message. Do not conduct personal conversations when the instructor 
is lecturing. Disciplinary action including removal from class will result. Personal computers or other electronic devices are not to 
be used in class for non-class related activities. 

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. The attendance policy as outlined in the campus catalog will be enforced. Students must notify me in the 
event of class absences.  Any student that is absent for more than two weeks without prior instructor notification may be dropped 
from the course. If you do not want to be in the class then you must drop yourself from the course.  I will not retroactively drop 
you if you miss one of the “last day” to drop the course dates.  These dates are listed in class schedule and in the online campus 
schedule “Important Dates” section. It is also expected that students will notify me before class in the rare instance of needing 
to leave class early.  Students, not notifying me in advance, will be marked absent upon their early departure.
